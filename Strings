######STRINGS  ---->>>>

# string="Hi Galaxy"
# #we can not use string like below
# string = "hi "galaxy"" ---XXXXX(False)
#
# #for this we have to type like this
#
# string = 'hi "galaxy"'-------(True)
#
# also we can not use this --->
# string = "hello everyo\ne \this eve\ning"
#
# for this input we have to make string to a raw string
#
# for this we have to type this----->
#     string = r"hello everyo\ne \this eve\ning"------>(True) r makes the input a raw string

###  STRING INDEXING --------->>>>>>>>>
# we have to use  the [] this function and start it from 0 to find a index value-->
#(also calculate spaces)
# st="Hello Shubham"
#
# print(st[6])  --->it will print "S"
#
# We can also COUNT THE length of string-0----->
#
# st="HELLO"
# print(len(st))     answer will be 5 because string length function excludess the last one :) ......
#####    STRING SLICING------->>>>>>
# stl = "H,E,L,L,O"
#
# print(stl[0:9:2])
#
# HERE   stl[ x : y : z ]
# x range == 0 to n OR -n
# y range == 0 to n+1  -(n+1)
# z range == 1 to n-1

####  STRING COMPARISON ---->>>>>>>
#
# ord() ----->>> This function gives the ASCII value of letters!! (It is requires every single letter to be checked if it is capital or small to  become equall)
# chr() ------>>> This function gives the word from the ASCII value .....

# to compare the operators are --------->>>>>> <,>,==
#
# example--->>

# str1= "Hello"
# str2= "HELLO"
#
# print(str1 == str2)               give false
#
#  In String Comparison is taken by each start value to end value at every point of Ascii value...

# for counting a number of string we can use count () and pass a argument in it to whom you want to find 
  Message = "hello world "
  Print (message.count ("l"))  #it gives you 3 as l apperas 3 times in the whole string
